    today was more of a learning day i cleared my all mistakes yeah before i was 
    implement xkb for input well it was wrong in the sense i was running the binary 
    directly in my system which its already running a x server so it was showing a 
    bad access error, look some tut and yeah finallyy figure it out

    - code refactore
    - remove xkb for input
    - use Xyphyr for window viewing
    - proper code structure
    - implemented tile 


Today was heavy lesson learnign day, i was able to clear my past mistackes ;)

    i was looking through tinyWM 
    he should how to implement mouse resize and move 
    IMPLEMENTED it failed
    the problem was i not using proper if else
    I;m still confused to wheather to use switch or if else
    or may be both ;; better

    useful stuff, need to digest what i coded,
    and do some indepth research on my current code
    MOST IMPORTANTLY: code refactor ;; make it clean
