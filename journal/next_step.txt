tinywm:     starting 
awsomwWM:   transparency

1. Understand X11 Basics
    Learn Xlib/XCB fundamentals
    Understand X server-client architecture
    Study core concepts: Display, Window, Event, GC (Graphics Context)

2. Setup Development Environment
3. Basic X11 Connection
4. Window Manager Framework

5. Event Handling System
    Implement select() or XNextEvent loop
    Handle basic events:
        KeyPress/KeyRelease
        ButtonPress/ButtonRelease
        MapRequest (new window)
        ConfigureRequest (window resize/move)
        DestroyNotify (window closed)

6. Window Management
// Implement linked list for clients

7. Basic Tiling Algorithm
Start with simple master-stack layout
void tile(WM *wm) {
    // 1. Arrange master window (left side, 50% width)
    // 2. Arrange stack windows (right side, vertical split)
    // 3. Apply positions to all windows
}

8. Layout Managers
Implement different layouts:
    Monocle (fullscreen)
    Grid
    Fibonacci
    Custom layouts

9. Window Focus Management
    Implement focus cycling
    Mouse focus following
    Visual focus indication (border colors)

10. Keybindings System
// Parse config file for keybindings
// Map keys to actions
// Implement keygrabbing

11. Status Bar
    Create a simple bar showing:
        Workspace info
        Window title
        System status
    Use Xft for fonts

12. Workspaces/Tags
    Multiple desktop implementation
    Window tagging system
    Workspace switching
    
13. Rules System
    Window matching by class/instance
    Automatic workspace assignment
    Floating window exceptions

14. IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
    Named pipes or UNIX sockets
    External control interface
    Status updates

15. Configuration
    Config.h pattern (like dwm)
    Runtime reconfiguration
    Patch system design

16. Performance Optimizations
    Reduce redraws
    Efficient algorithms
    Memory management

17. Bug Fixes & Testing
    Handle edge cases
    Memory leak detection
    Stress testing

18. Documentation
    Code comments
    User manual
