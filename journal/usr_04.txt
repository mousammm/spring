progress: got a x server working with Mod4+CR for terminal open and 
            MOD4+Q to close 

learned:
    man XOpenDisplay
    man XCloseDisplay
    man XEvent

connecting to x server to was easy 
P1: can get keyboard input 
    but after some time i got this discussion really helpful
        https://gist.github.com/jouyouyun/669726de58df8d333666

    key input impossible with regular Xlib,
    because only one client can register for button press on a window.
    can be done using X input extensions and by listening XI_RawButtonPress Event,

    this help in key input 
        #include <X11/extensions/XInput2.h> // for input raw input dont work

P2: event 
     this is depricated
        X(display, event.xkey.keycode, 0);

     from #include <X11/XKBlib.h> 
        XkbKeycodeToKeysym (display, event.xkey.keycode, 0, 0);
 
 Conclusion:
    learned a lot 
    got stuck find the sol
    repeat
